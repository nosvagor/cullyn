#
# 2. Repository Pattern Implementation:
# - Each domain-specific .go file (e.g., llc.go) implements the repository pattern.
# - This encapsulates all database operations for that specific domain.
# - Provides a clean API for domain-specific database interactions.
#
# 3. Adapter Pattern Implementation:
# - Domain-specific files (e.g., llc.go) serve as adapters.
# - They translate between the application's domain models and database representations.
# - This separation allows for changes in database schema without affecting business logic.
#
# 4. Facade Pattern Implementation (in store.go):
# - Aggregates all domain-specific stores (repositories).
# - Offers a unified and simplified API for the entire data access layer.
# - Manages complex operations that may span multiple domains.
#
# 5. Extending the Configuration for New Domains:
# - Add a new entry in the 'overrides' section above.
# - Follow the established pattern (see 'llc' domain as an example).
# - Create corresponding directories in 'sqlc/', 'queries/', and a new adapter file.
# - Update store.go to include the new domain in the facade.
#
# 6. Best Practices and Guidelines:
# - Maintain strict separation of concerns between domains.
# - Utilize dependency injection for improved testability and flexibility.
# - Implement transactional methods within domain-specific adapter files.
# - Use the facade (store.go) for operations spanning multiple domains.
# - Keep SQL queries in .sql files, allowing for easier review and version control.
# - Organize queries by entity (e.g., users.sql, posts.sql) within each domain.
# - Regularly update SQLC-generated code when changing queries or schema.
#
# This architecture provides a modular, maintainable, and scalable approach to
# managing database operations across multiple domains or services. It allows
# for easy extension and modification as the application grows and evolves.
